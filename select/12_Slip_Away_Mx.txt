Every time you look at me a part of me comes alive
I've been dead inside for so long and I was starting to lose my mind
Never thought it come to this
A feeling as good as this and even though we fight I know
We'll always make things right

Don't slip away
Don't slip away
Don't slip away

Don't slip away
Don't slip away
Don't slip away

I know it's hard to understand a girl like me
But for you it's easy
And you let me be
Up and down we go
Boy I can't let you go
All these memories amongst all these enemies
But we get it together
That's why we're together
Me and you that's forever
Let you go I will never

Every time you look at me a part of me comes alive
I've been dead inside for so long and I was starting to lose my mind
Never thought it come to this
A feeling as good as this and even though we fight I know
We'll always make things right

Don't slip away
Don't slip away
Don't slip away

Don't slip away
Don't slip away
Don't slip away

Don't slip away
Don't slip away
Don't slip away
