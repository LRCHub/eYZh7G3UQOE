This slip of a girl has slipped right through
And now I don't know what to do
I know most anyone would walk a way
But there's something about
This slip of a girl that's making me stay

You know that
I'd do anything for you now
I'd do anything for you
Just to see you look at me now baby
Just a slip of a girl
