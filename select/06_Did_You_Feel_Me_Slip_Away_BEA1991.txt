Bad resentfuls never stick around a long time
I advocate the quiet

Are we better, better, better?

Tell her, tell her, tell her
Bad resentfuls never stick around a long time
I advocate the quiet
I'm good enough
[?] seein' it
It's gonna, gonna, gonna turn around
'Cause I'm better than this
Tell her, tell her, tell her
Tell her, tell her, tell her
Tell her, tell her, tell her
Bad resentfuls never stick around a long time
I advocate the quiet
Tell her, tell her, tell her
